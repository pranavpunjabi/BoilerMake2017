This particle module powered device renders user preference screens on two 0.96'' screens showing the most pertinent information precluding the usage of the phone for checking trivial but crucial details like date, time, temperature, stocks and others based on preference settings defined per device ID in a MongoDB framework.

The events shown on the screen are subscribed to by the particle photon and the Node JS service satisfies the GET requests sent out by this very module.

My Contributions:
1) The rendering on the screens is done via the SSD 1331 libraries using SPI interfacing.
2) It also shows bank account information received in a secure format using Capital One's API calls.
3) Packaging of the product is done keeping size and cost as a factor. The stand-alone equipment without any mass production costs $25 a piece. It could do wonders if mass produced.
